🎶 BeepSong
BeepSong is a C++ application that allows users to generate sound using the internal speaker of their computer. It parses a text file containing musical notes and durations, and plays them sequentially through the speaker.

✨ Features
🎼 Parse a text file with musical notes and their durations.
🔊 Play the notes using the computer's internal speaker.
🎵 Supports basic musical notes like C, D, E, F, G, A, B, along with custom durations in milliseconds.
🛠️ How It Works
📄 The user provides a text file with a specific format where each line contains a note and its duration.
🔍 BeepSong reads the file and processes the notes.
🎶 The software generates sound through the internal speaker using the system's Beep() function (on Windows).

Example Input
A sample file named song.txt could contain the following:

C 400
C 400
G 400
G 400
A 400
A 400
G 400
W 500
F 400
F 400
E 400
E 400
D 400
D 400
C 400

📝 Each line consists of a note (e.g., C, G, A) followed by its duration in milliseconds (e.g., 400 ms).
🎧 Output
The program will play the notes on the computer's speaker based on the provided durations.
